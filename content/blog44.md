Hi! I am Drishti Goyal, a Masters in Analytics and Management student at London Business School. I was born in India, raised in Malaysia and so always feel lucky to have 2 homes :) I completed my Bachelors in Engineering from Thapar University in 2022, and pursued a 5-month internship at JP Morgan Chase as a member of the Focused Analytics Solutions Team.

## Hobbies
1. Table-tennis - I was the Girls Team Captain during my undergrad and participated in many inter-university competitions     
2. Swimming - I have always been a water-baby for as long as I can remember         
3. Travelling - Thanks to my parents, I have visited over 15 countries and love exploring new cultures and cuisines

4. Painting - Very recently, I took up painting during lockdown and quickly realized that it was not my cup of tea. But sometimes when inspiration strikes, I take up my brush and let my thoughts flow.

## Family
I have a small family of four consisting of my parents and a baby brother. I am extremely close to them and spend as much time as possible with them. My parents are my greatest inspirations and my constant cheerleaders, and celebrate even the smallest of achievements with so much pride, as if I won the Nobel prize :) Below is a picture of me annoying my brother to the best of my capabilities xD

## Volunteering          
During my free time, I love to volunteer and help out for any social cause. I have previously run a 10km marathon for "Youth Against Drugs" organised by YIMF. I also worked with Ed Lodge, an organisation aimed to provide education to the underprivileged students, wherein I would take interviews of prospective tutors and prepare worksheets. I also volunteered for Balkalakar 2019 organised by AIESEC, which was a day of fun and games for children living in rural areas.
